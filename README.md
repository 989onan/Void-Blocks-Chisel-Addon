# Chisel Void Blocks Mod
This mod adds void blocks to minecraft 1.20.1. I had to do a lot of texture work, and basically redo how the blocks render their pixels (spoiler alert, I had to fudge some stuff)

Regardless, I don't know if I will give continued support, but this brings the blocks so far forward into modern minecraft, it will make future ports hopefully easier.

I may release this on modrinth soon.
